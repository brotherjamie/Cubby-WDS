 <div class="articleintro"><div class="introwords"><p class="tipheading">By Jamie Vaughan - 26th March 2021</p><p>I am no expert, but over the last 3 years I have become a little bit obsessed with painting and modelling miniatures. Its not 100% the same as scale modelling real world planes trains and auto-mobiles, but our camps are settled not so far apart. I feel I’ve advanced a lot in this short time and thought, if I were to pass on some advice, what would I say? Well here it is, my humble advice in a nutshell, some pointers that may expand your horizons as a scale model enthusiast! </p></div><div class="picboxright"><span class="authorborder"><img src="images/wraithblades.jpg" class="authorpic cubbyimg" title="Wraithblades" alt="Wraithblades"></span><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Some of my Aedari army - Wraithblades</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/wetpalette.jpg" title="wet palette" alt="wet palette"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">A wet palette. Its been well used.</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p> Today's Topic: The Wet Palette.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;To understand a wet palette, you first need to have struggled with a dry one. The paint dries out fast, is hard to maintain a moisture level that suits the paint and worst of all, it’s wasteful. When you’ve painted 100 Space Marines in a row, the same problems crop up, my paint is dry again. So you’re conscious of time ticking away before you need fresh paint again. We don’t need that stress! 
 </p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>Enter the wet palette. Used right, solves these issues. It also offers a unique situation, where the custom colour you’ve just created is now usable a month later! (I’ve even heard tales of years later, but I can’t vouch for quality of the paint by then) I love the fact this takes the pressure off, and it speeds things up. Techniques like wet blending become much more feasible. My favourite part about using a wet palette, is when I feel like doing some painting, I can be set up, correct colours at hand, within seconds. That hesitation to continue painting is wonderfully diminished. </p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/captaincape.jpg" title="A wet blended Cloak" alt="A wet blended Cloak"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">My attempt at wet blending, made much easier with a wet palette.</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><a href="https://www.bulldogmodels.co.uk/products/acrylic-wet-pallet?_pos=1&_sid=602e09b2e&_ss=r&variant=41508943167641" target="_blank"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/bulldogpalette1.jpg" title="Click to go to product - Bulldog Models Wet palette" alt="Bulldog Models Wet palette link"></a><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Our friends at Bulldog Models do a rather nice palette. Click to visit!</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>If I’ve not sold it to you yet, there is a financial incentive too. You could buy a model shop set up for a wet palette. It’ll usually cost about £15, often with sponge and paper included, and these work great. Or you can try the DIY option of a shallow, Tupperware pot (with airtight lid), a kitchen flannel and some baking paper cut to size. This will barely cost you any coins at all and you will be stocked for years. The cost of either option will be mitigated in no time at all as you will be using a fraction of the paint used previously on a dry palette.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>Correct use of a wet palette is needed. Keep the amount of moisture in the pot balanced. Water should only just be visible when you roll the palette about a bit. Too much and the top surface floods and contaminates the rest of the palette. Too little and you’re back to using a dry palette. Its not a difficult balance to find though. Also try to identify your baking papers waxy side and use that as the top surface. When mixing your paint, your brush will rub the surface and may rough up the baking paper, and in turn add fibres to your paint. Waxy side up will limit this.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/palettematerials.jpg" title="wet palette materials" alt="wet palette materials"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">These days, I cut a bunch of replacements to size in advance.</p>

 <div class="hobbytipsheading"><h3 class="heading"> Paint Brush Care</h3></div>
 <div class="articleintro"><div class="introwords"><p class="tipheading">By Jamie Vaughan - 15th April 2021</p><p>I’ve been using paint brushes for a long time without having a clue about them. You might think for a professional artist with a degree in Painting and Printmaking, and well over 20 years of painting experience, I might have known a thing or two about the tools of my trade. However, having reapplied myself to learning how to paint miniatures, I have found a number of techniques that really help with brush care. Okay so I didn’t grow up with the internet, not a lot of us did I’d imagine! So what have I found out since then? What was I getting so wrong.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><span class="authorborder"><img src="images/jamievaughan.jpg" class="authorpic cubbyimg" title="artist Jamie Vaughan at work" alt="artist Jamie Vaughan at work"></span><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Mixed Media Artist, Jamie Vaughan - that's me in my workshop</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/badbrushcare.jpg" title="Some poorly cared for Brushes" alt="Some poorly cared for Brushes"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Oh my poor brushes - examples of how not to treat your brushes</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>My brush care was atrocious. I’d leave brushes sat in dirty water for days. Paint would cover the brush head to toe. Once finished with, I’d not clean the brush properly. It embarrasses me to think what little care I took. And so I was going through brushes at an appalling rate. The handle would split and the coat would flake off. The bristles would splay open, uncontrollable. Masking tape used to hold the brush together would get soaked and fall off in bits. I’d wrongly blame these cheap, hand-me-down brushes, and assume that the reason for my issues was that I didn’t have the money for decent brushes.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>I’ve also heard a lot of talk of the differences between synthetic and natural sable bristles, which I’m not going to go into detail in this article. That using natural sable bristles are superior, and yet also stories of chemical cleaners or water that’s too hot weakening some brushes. Well of course it depends entirely on what paint you’re using the brush with, and what you’re cleaning the brush with after. For the purposes of this article I will be talking about using brushes with acrylic paint, but some advice will certainly cross over to other mediums.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/paintbrush.jpg" title="Variety of brushes" alt="Variety of brushes"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Used, but cared for brushes</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/ferrule.jpg" title="the ferrule is the metal collar where the bristles are mounted" alt="the ferrule is the metal collar where the bristles are mounted"><div class="central"><p class="picheading"></p>The ferrule is the metal collar where the bristles are mounted</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>Keep your ferrule clean! This is the metal casing around the bristles. If any paint is allowed to dry inside there, it will harden, and separate the bristles. That’s right, it wasn’t the cheap-o brush’s fault, it was you all along! This can be remedied later on, but the best cure is prevention. Don’t dip your brush deep into the paint, only allow the tip of the brush to touch the paint and you won’t have this problem in the first place. If you’ve allowed paint in there by accident, clean it immediately. If the paint dries, things get more difficult to clean but not impossible. A soak in an appropriate paint cleaner, then gently easing out the paint onto a clean cloth can recover your brush. But the more paint stuck in there, the more bristles you’re going to inadvertently pull out. </p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>When you’ve finished with a brush, clean it immediately. A simple discipline. Don’t leave it sitting in your water (or your ‘not drink’ mug). Yes the paint wont dry on it like that, but you’re training the bristols to bend to one side, and that’s no good. Keep your brush clean and straight. Let it dry shaped to a point and store it tip upward. Maybe even use those little plastic sleeves it came with. If you know where that went, I’ve no idea as to the location of mine though. Also worth keeping 2 water jars for cleaning, saving one for metallic based paints. This will prevents unwanted sparkles. Change your water frequently too. </p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/waterpots.jpg" title="Water Pots" alt="Water Pots"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">'M' for cleaning metal paint!</p></div></div></div>

Your best, grade ‘A’, brush should be spared from the heavy lifting. That fine point is your greatest ally! Avoid using it with metallic paints. Avoid using it with ink washes that will get in the ferrule. In fact your pretty much only going to use it for those fine finishing details and mid to upper layers of acrylic paint. Base coating should be completed using a larger, less refined brush. If you’re a dry-brusher, expect this technique to either destroy your brush in short time, or switch to a make up blusher brush. Don’t be embarrassed, head down to your local make up supplier.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>After some use, even with great care,  your ferrule is still going to fill up with paint particles. After spending some time repeatedly discussing which chemical to clean acrylic paint with, there has been, in my mind, one winner over all. Isopropanol, also known as Isopropyl Alcohol. This stuff is dangerous. Its near 100% alcohol. Using it in confined spaces with no respirator is going to get you drunk in a bad way. It’ll damage your lungs, and if it goes anywhere near a flame, say goodbye to your eyebrows. Some professional outlets, like watch repair shops, will only ration out very small amounts for use during watch cleaning due to its volatile nature. And absolutely do not use it in combination with an ultrasonic cleaner! (Flammable liquid and electrical devices don’t mix!).</p> </div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/isopropanol.jpg" style="max-height: 100%" title="Isopropanol or Isopropyl Alcohol" alt="Isopropanol or Isopropyl Alcohol"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Here it is, the mega stuff that will clean most things. Handle with care!</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>Having said all of this, Isopropanol will strip acrylic paint. Many a discussion as to cleaning products from the antiseptic cleaner ‘Dettol’, to the Americans ‘Simple Green’, has been had by many miniature painters out there (its almost a repeated weekly discussion on one group I am part of), but the active ingredient that is doing the heavy work is Isoproponol. Get yourself on Ebay, and order a litre of the stuff. Madly, they will post this to you in the UK, no fuss! I bet you never knew being a postal worker was potentially such a dangerous job!</p></div></div>

Time for brush conditioner. There are a few sources online that suggest using hair conditioner or clothes conditioner. There are also dedicated paint brush conditioner soaps out there as well. It might seem like a bit of over-care, but once you’ve bitten the bullet and purchased that highly recommended sable brush, it would be prudent to make it last as long as you can.</p></div></div>

 <div class="hobbytipsheading"><h3 class="heading"> Scenery Building</h3></div>
 <div class="articleintro"><div class="introwords"><p class="tipheading">By Jamie Vaughan - 1st June 2021</p><p>I recently came into possession of a martian landscape battle mat. It is a photo realistic, 6'x 4' mouse mat for playing Warhammer 40k on, and I love it. However, it made my scenery for the game look rather poor! So I decided to create a batch of scenery to match it! Here is my little journey of production.</p></div><div class="picboxright largerpic"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/scenery and mat.jpg" title="scenery and mat" alt="scenery and mat"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">The finished effect, matching the mat.</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/plastic scenery.jpg" title="Plastic Scenery" alt="Plastic Scenery"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Some plastic, preformed scenery from Games Workshop</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>Here is the Plastic scenery I had previously purchased and assembled. It's a far cry from the cardboard houses I would build as a kid! Some of the details and styles on these models would be hard to replicate, but not impossible, but my priority has always been building the models, these are just meant to be background scenery.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>As ever with any painting on plastic, it needed priming. I used Vallejo's grey primer. There is apparently better out there but I have a bottle to get through first. I needed to sieve the paint before putting it in the airbrush, as the paint had gone lumpy, even after a thorough shake. Might be because my shed's outdoors and has endured a winter or two? I don't know.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/primed plastic.jpg" title="primed plastic" alt="primed plastic"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">My little spray booth. It's in my shed and I wear a good mask for safety</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/black basecoat.jpg" title="black basecoat" alt="black basecoat"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Vallejo's Nato Black for a basecoat</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>I then gave it all a basecoat of Vallejo's Nato black. It's not a true black, It's actually a very very very dark grey (Father Ted reference anyone?). It gives a lovely matt finish that gives even blacker blacks somewhere to go, while allowing other paints to adhere to it beautifully.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>Next was a dry brush of a metallic paint, in this case I used Citadel's Leadbelcher Air paint (because it was already on my shelf) If I wanted I could stop here as this produces an amazing effect, but I'm going further with this. I used a large make up brush to apply this and it did its job quickly and cleanly.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/metal drybrushed.jpg" title="metal drybrushed" alt="metal drybrushed"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Metallic paint Drybrushed on</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/copper added.jpg" title="copper added" alt="copper added"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">A metallic copper paint is added to highlight a few details</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>I didn't want to go mad detailing these pieces, but a few additions can go a long way. The colour needed to be very strong for the next stage to take effect correctly, so I had to be patient and stick to the plan!</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>Next I switched to to an enamel paint, AK Interactives Rust Streaks. Its talent in a tin as far as I'm concerned. There will be other brands out there but this one works. You can spray this fairly liberally, but I added extra to the lower half to give the impression of dust concentrations. It's benefit of being an enamel is that it takes a long time to dry. So theres no hurry, but I had to be careful handling the pieces afterwards.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/rust added.jpg" title="rust added" alt="rust added"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Enamel paint, AK Interactives Rust Streaks.</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/remove rust.jpg" title="remove rust" alt="remove rust"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Cleaning off the excess rust.</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p> Next stage was to clean off the excess rust. I used biodegradable cottonbuds (because what else are they for?!). Often I've seen oil and enamel miniature painters using these with alcohol to clean off paints, but with this enamal paint, it isn't needed. Wherever upper highlights needed to be retained, I cleaned off the edges of the models. It took a few days to properly dry after this.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>In this next image, I've skipped ahead because I didn't technically do this until later on. But I have added Revell's weathering powders kit rather heavily to the bases of the pieces to simulate red Martian dust gathering at the base (I know, I know, Mars isn't really that red!). Also added Nikalah Oxide from Citadel to give the copper an older, more realistic rusted look.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/weathering and verdigris.jpg" title="weathering and verdigris" alt="weathering and verdigris"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">I added some weathering dust to the base and verdigris to the copper.</p></div></div></div> <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/sand and stones drying.jpg" title="sand and stones drying" alt="sand and stones drying"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">It was a sunny day, and the sand and stones needed drying out first.</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>Ok, so, onto the bases for these pieces and a few other pieces of scenery I had in mind. I needed to make the texture somewhat rocky and sandy, so what better way to simulate that, than actual rocks and sand! In an ideal world I'd have used a variety of sizes of sand to get the scale looking right, but I had some sand left over from some building work, so I was happy enough using that for now.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>I needed some bases cut next. I had a tonne of MDF knocking about so I used that. It's not ideal , but if it's prepared correctly it will do. I used a vertical fret saw to cut these out but a hand fret saw would do the job just fine. Just a hell of a lot quicker with the right tools!</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/wood cut.jpg" title="wood cut" alt="wood cut"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">MDF bases cut using a Vertical Fret Saw.</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/wood primed.jpg" title="wood primed" alt="wood primed"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">The MDF has been carefully primed here.</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>As just mentioned, MDF is not ideal for bases, as the slightest bit of water will warp and enlarge it. And we're using paint here... So I primed the bases very sparingly all over the surface and edges, let it dry, then repeated. Important to not warp the MDF with the layer thats supposed to protect it! As it turned out, this did an excellent job protecting the wood from warpage.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p> I've a fair amount of experience with using tiling grout, and I'd noticed that in large enough amounts, it cracks all over the place. That's what I want my craters to look like! Being careful not to add too much water, I mixed up some tiler's finishing grout into an almost clay like consistancy. I was then able to shape it onto the base and make a crater shape.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/craters shaped.jpg" title="craters shaped" alt="craters shaped"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Tiling grout used as modelling clay.</p></div></div></div>
 <div class="section1"><div class="picboxleft"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/glue on sand.jpg" title="glue on sand" alt="glue on sand"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Sand was glued on liberally</p></div></div><div class="sectionwords"><p>I glued on  some printed paper scenery that came with my miniatures and glued the pieces to their bases. I wanted to make all the surface areas have texture now, so I glued on big rocks, little rocks and then added a layer of sand to all the bases. It was easiest to put the sand in a pot and dip the glued pieces in one at a time. I then left the glue to dry over night.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>I base coated everything a dark brown red colour, using fairly basic acrylic paint (not the good stuff for your models!). Then took a large brush and dabbed on a middle reddy orange. Once that was dry I made up a mix of black and brown acrylic paint, mixed it with a bit of alcohol to break it down, then added a fair bit of water. This created a wash that could seep into all the deepest parts and give it depth. I added a bit at the bottom of the structures as well.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/ready for dust.jpg" title="ready for dust" alt="ready for dust"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">Base coated and ready for the final layer of 'dust'</p></div></div></div>

I got out my old pastels and scrapped off all sorts of tones and colours, constantly referrring to a picture of my mat. It needed a range of browns reds and yellows, but in the end I reverted back to using my Revell's weathering set. My supply took a hammering but I think it was worth it.</p></div></div>
 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p>After a few layers, going back and forth, I ended up settling with this appearance. I think in future I might add more rocks and debris, but for now it's done! I added a quick layer of cheapo hair spray to seal it in. For a moment it looked too dark but it dried out light again.</p></div><div class="picboxright"><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/scenery/weathered crater.jpg" title="weathered crater" alt="weathered crater"><div class="central"><p class="picheading">The finished weathering effect</p></div></div></div>

I had to set it all up with two of my painted armies to demonstrate the effect, but it really takes my breath away seeing it in person. I think it will always be work in progress but what's been achieved so far hasn't been too taxing. I can't wait to have some battles now!</p></div></div>

One would have thought that when under compulsory lockdown we model makers would have been in our element. Hoarding products is a big part of who we are and we were born for this moment right? I thought I’d hear a deafening clamour as everyone rushed to their benches. Instead, something surprising happened. </p></div>

 <div class="sectionwords"><p>Most people will tell you they almost stopped building, or at least their pace dropped off significantly. A lot of us opted for at home bars, learning to cook the food we couldn’t get take away; and paying homage to our expanding waistlines. If anything, it went a long way towards proving that we are, against everything that’s been said about us, very social animals. When the curtain fell, and the chips were laid down, we missed each other; and the energy our meetings and shenanigans provided. We are, despite what the press might say, quite social animals, within our own kind at least. The outside world though? They can still stay at arms length right?  </p></div></div>

 <div class="section2"><div class="sectionwords"><p class="tipheading">By Lee Hayward - 18th January 2022</p><p>I’ve just finished this gnarly old Tamiya 1/48 FRS1. It wasn’t as bad as people had me believe, especially once realising all that’s needed to make it a not-so horrific build-wise is to fit the engine in, cover it, THEN attach the jet nozzles to the fuselage. </p><img class="cubbyimg" src="images/FRS1 box and instructions.jpg" title="FRS1 box and instructions" alt="FRS1 box and instructions"></div>

 <div class="sectionwords"><p>I did an after-market scheme, so this is the XZ457 HMS Hermes. She had all her markings overpainted dark sea grey all over by brush whilst on Hermes and only basic markings re-applied. Each of the markings are well documented for this aircraft. She sports her kill markings. The gun pods were loaned to her by the RAF. </p></div></div>
